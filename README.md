## Internship
Cyber Security Internship – CodeAlpha

## Project Title
Password Strength Checker

## Objective
To evaluate the strength of user passwords based on length, complexity, and character variety, and to create awareness about strong password practices.

## Description
This project demonstrates how password strength can be assessed using common security rules such as minimum length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Strong passwords help protect user accounts from brute-force and credential-based attacks.

## Key Criteria Checked
- Password length
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters
- Overall strength rating (Weak / Medium / Strong)

## Status
Project completed
